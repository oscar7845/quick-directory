# Quick Directory Navigator
This tool offers an easily accessible menu structure of all your mounted storage right from your system tray. You can double click a drive or a directory to open it in the file explorer, or single click a file to open it in the default app. You can also drag a folder or file outside the menu to move/copy/link it elsewhere.
## The Idea
The idea was to find a way to save time, minimize clicks and make the process of accessing files and directories more smooth. The application provides a quick and simple way to navigate through their storage drives and directories.
